~DESCRIPTION:The Figma design project, showcasing a concept for an augmented reality (AR) candlelight dinner experience called "Atomy." The design features a serene lakeside setting at dusk, with a pyramid-shaped building and a boat on the water. The project's background image is overlaid with a white square containing a black logo, which depicts two people sitting at a table surrounded by candles.

~The Figma project is displayed on a mobile device, with the Figma webpage open in the browser. The top of the screen features a black status bar with various icons, including the time, signal strength, and battery level. Below the status bar is a dark gray toolbar with white text that reads "Figma" and "figma.com." A white checkmark is visible to the left of the text, accompanied by a share icon and a bookmark icon on the right side. The title "Untitled" is centered in the toolbar.

~The design concept for Atomy aims to create a peaceful and romantic ambiance, perfect for a unique dining experience. The use of AR technology allows for an immersive and interactive experience, enhancing the overall mood and atmosphere of the dinner. The logo and branding elements are simple yet elegant, fitting well with the serene and natural surroundings.
